### Skills: String formatting

## Instructions

A lot of times we need to deal with user input in our programs. Unfortunately, users don't always give us the input the way we expect it. To fix this we'll need to write methods that take user input and always output the output we expect.

In this todo you'll be formatting an ugly phone number input like this: 5194557018 into a prety phone number output, like this: (519) 455-7018

1. Define a method named normalize_phone_number that takes one
string argument and returns a string in the format
(XXX) XXX-XXXX if possible, and just returns the input string if not
